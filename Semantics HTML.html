                    <h2>DOG FACTS</h2>
                    <p>Dogs (Canis familiaris) are domesticated mammals, descended from wolves, known as "man's best friend" for their loyalty and companionship, with incredible senses (smell, hearing) and diverse breeds developed for various tasks like hunting, guarding, or assistance, cooling down by panting and expressing emotions through tail wags. They are intelligent, can learn many words, and have unique nose prints, making them the world's most popular pet.

                <aside><p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.</p></aside>
